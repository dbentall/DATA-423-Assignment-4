Model training, comparison, selection and testing

This assignment is to compare the regression performance of 6 different machine learning 
models on a toy dataset with 220 observations and 20 variables. Performance will be 
evaluated based on cross-validation of MAE, RMSE and R^2, and the best model will be
selected and evaluated on the testing data.
